                    <p>Kolsay Lakes in Kazakhstan have been nicknamed the Blue Necklace of the Northern Tien Shan, and anyone who sets eyes on these natural beauties will quickly understand why. When the surface of the waters are perfectly calm they reflect the sky, while in the evening the lakes appear to boil as trout splash about in their crystal waters.

                        “Kolsay” means “Valley Lake” in the Kazakh language, for these freshwater lakes lie in a valley in the Northern Tien Shan Mountains some 300 kilometers from Almaty. The three lakes – Verkhneye (Upper), Mynzholki (Middle) and Nizhneye (Lower) - are located at 2,700, 2,250 and 1,800 meters above sea level, respectively. Each is fed by glacier water from the Kolsay River, which flows down from the Kungey Alatau Mountains. The lakes are known for their depth, which reaches up to 80 meters at Lower Kolsay Lake and 50 meters at Middle Kolsay Lake. Along parts of the shores, however, shallow spots void of crags may also be found.</p>

                    <p>A beautiful lake with a lot of fish. And also a life-giving forest. It's a pity that the trip was only one lake. They say that the 2nd lake is the most beautiful.</p>
